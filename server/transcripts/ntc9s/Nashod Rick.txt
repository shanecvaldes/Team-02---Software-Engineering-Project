What happened, what we did, what we lost, there's got to be something after those who have their hands, they'll put them down. We're all going to go home now. Negan's alive, but his way of doing things is over. And anyone who can't live with that will pay the price. I promise you that. Any person here who would live in peace and fairness, who would find common ground, this world is yours by right. We are life. That's death, and it's coming for us. Unless we stand together. So go home. Then the work begins. The new world begins.
