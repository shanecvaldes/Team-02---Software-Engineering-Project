CJ Stroud dropping back, throwing a dope incomplete, that's terrible. He almost had at least a 15 yard completion and the wide receiver just sucks. He dives. It was there, it was in his hands, he just didn't catch it. Explain to me how a winning football program is not winning? They are beating the lines. Oh never mind defender got it. My bad. Wide receiver doesn't suck, but still. Catch the *** **** football.
