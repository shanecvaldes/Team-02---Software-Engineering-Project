We need to ask geese. The Canadian geese are taking over our parks. They're crapping everywhere and little kids are exposed to that crap which carries viruses and bacteria that is very harmful to children. Also, we could use the meat for the homeless, for the dog shelters. We could use the feathers, make blankets, pillows, coats, all the things the homeless needs. We can exterminate all these dengues from our parks. Destroying golf courses, Parks.
