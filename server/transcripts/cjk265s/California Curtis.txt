Should California still be in the United States, or should we kick them out? They do nothing for us. They have terrible laws. All the people are terrible. They don't know how to drive. They're full of just weird people. There are some people in there that should not exist. I mean, the only thing they got going for him is Kings Canyon National Park in Sequoia National Park and the Redwood trees. OK, but they have fires. They have the San Andreas Fault. Who wants to deal with all this? We're paying for it for no damn reason. They have huge taxes. They clearly can support themselves if they want to support the homeless and just keep people down. It is so corrupt they're throwing people in jail just for free labor. It is insane. There need to be stopped. They are corrupt. There is nothing good coming out of California. It needs to be stopped.
