Look, I've had it. You all sit here judging me, acting like you're so perfect, like you've never messed up. I see the way you look at me, the whispers, the side glances. Don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about. I've been there for each one of you when you needed something. But the minute I screw up, suddenly I'm the problem. I don't owe anything. Just leave me alone. Let me live my life without you breathing down my neck all the time.
