Alright, Is it smarter to get pints or pictures here? Obviously the price difference is going to be a little bit cheaper with pictures, but it forces you to drink more than pints. If you get pictures, it's about 412 ounce strings, but if you get pints it's 16 ounces. So our difference in prices really catches up and really equalizes and it pushes you to drink more than you really should. So you shouldn't ever get a picture by yourself even though people. Will get a picture by themselves. Is it correct? Should you always get a picture? Should you get a bucket of beer? That's 6 beers right by itself, but that's 12 * 6. That is 72. That may be too much, who knows?
